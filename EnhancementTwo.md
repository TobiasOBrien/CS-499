# Enhancement Two: Algorithms and Data Structures

The artifact that has been chosen for Enhancement Two:  Algorithms and Data Structure was the final project from CS-260 Data Structure and Algorithms that was completed in October of 2019.  The final project focused on applying appropriate data structures to organize data in a way that it could help the customer solve problems.  The program was written in C++ and took data from a CSV file that contained bids on surplus items that were offered for sale from the Nashville government.  The main goal was to provide managers of eBid Nashville a way to access information on the items sold.

I choose this artifact as I wanted to gain additional exposure to C++, wanted to take on the challenge of converting C++ to Python, and saw a need to improve the initial results.  I remember taking the CS-260 class and thinking that the outcomes, although having satisfied the requirements of the rubric could have been improved on in the real world.  The initial project allowed the end user to load the bids, display the bids, find a single hard coded bid, and remove a hard coded bid.  This restriction of having bids hard coded to me did not allow for end user to have flexibility.

Taking an existing piece of software written in another language and converting it to another along with adding additional functionality showed my ability to design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to the solution.  This exercise also demonstrates my ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value.  

In my history with software development, I have always been decent at taking an existing program and being able to make modification that meet my needs.  Starting from blank slate like I did in this exercise has been something that I have always struggled with.  I learned a lot about how to implement menus, how to take user input, how to convert data types, the flow of software and the importance of testing, and how to manipulate data frames.

As mentioned, the program was re-written from C++ to Python and implemented a user menu options that, driven by user input, allowed the end user to easily display the data that they wanted.  The effort involved the importing of the CSV and the development of many different data frame manipulation methods.  In the end user can Import the CSV, display the full dataset, list departments and number of records, search for all records above a certain net sales amount, and search records by auction title keyword.  I learned how to start from scratch with a program, build a foundation and build that foundation to a working model.  I had some struggles with the exact code that was needed for each search function with the data frame but through additional research and trial and error was able to accomplish the goal.

This artifact allowed me to showcase the course outcomes of CS-499-04 demonstrating an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals, CS-499-03 designing and evaluating computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution, while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices, and CS-499-01 employing strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision making in the field of computer science.
