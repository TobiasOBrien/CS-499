## Introduction

My name is Tobias O'Brien and I have been in the IT industry for close to 30 years now and started my journey in the Computer Science Program at Southern New Hampshire University in 2017.  My main motivators for starting this program were to finish a degree that I had started 30 years ago and to further develop my knowledge in Computer Science and Software Development.  I currently manage a team of Software and Infrastructure engineers and having this knowledge will assist me in furthering their development and help me drive better conversations with our customers.

## Career Information

My career has afforded me the opportunity to gain exposure to many different areas of technology.  After completing some college courses, I took part in an 18-month course in Electronics, Computers, and Networking that allowed to get my first job at a VAR involved in the design, installation, and support of business networks systems.  Reflecting that this was in 1992 and Operating systems still came on floppy discs it feels like a lifetime ago.

While working for this VAR I learned quickly and was soon working on developing and maintaining IT systems for small to medium businesses.  The work involved included setting up Microsoft and Novell networks, to include the directories, email, shared file, printing, networks, firewalls, internet connectivity, and user workstations.  Along with the exposure to the software and applications required, I worked heavily with the server, desktop, mobile, storage, networking, and security hardware that was needed.
