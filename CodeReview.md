# Planned Enhancements and Code Review

## Planned Ennhancements

### Enahncement One: Software Egineering and Design

My first artifact enhancement was focused on the final project from IT-145 Foundations in Application Development where a Zoo authentication system for a Zoo was created allow users to be authenticated and presented with a login message based upon their role.  The program was written in Java and utilized a MD5 hashing algorithm to validate the userâ€™s password and various Java elements to cross match the users name and role.

###  Enhancement Two:  Algorithms and Data Structures

My second artifact enhancement was focused on the final project from CS-260 Data Structure and Algorithms where a bid search system was created that allowed users to load a bid file from a comma separated file and perform various searches to display data.  The program was written in C++ implement techniques such as displaying a user menu, loading, and parsing a CSV file, displaying results, and searching for bids.

### Enahncement Three:  Databases

My third artifact enhancement was focused on the final project from DAD-220 Introduction to SQL where different way of interacting with a MySQL database were explored.  The project utilized a Virtual Environment that was provided by SNHU that was preloaded with the MySQL environment and associated database and my project developed MySQL command line code to interact with the database.
