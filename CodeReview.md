# Planned Enhancements and Code Review

## Planned Ennhancements

### Enahncement One: Software Egineering and Design

My first artifact enhancement was focused on the final project from IT-145 Foundations in Application Development where a authentication system for a Zoo was created allow users to be authenticated and presented with a login message based upon their role. The program was written in Java and utilized a MD5 hashing algorithm to validate the user’s password and various Java elements to cross match the users name and role.

My enhancement will add an additional option to allow the user to select either the existing MD5 hashing algorithm or a new, more secure, SHA-256 option.  During the code review it was also noticed that there was a bug in the code that allowed for usernames that weren’t a one for one match, this bug will also be addressed.

###  Enhancement Two:  Algorithms and Data Structures

My second artifact enhancement was focused on the final project from CS-260 Data Structure and Algorithms where a bid search system was created that allowed users to load a bid file from a comma separated file and perform various searches to display data. The program was written in C++ and implemented techniques such as displaying a user menu, loading and parsing a CSV file, displaying results, and searching for bids.

My enhancements will transform the program from C++ to Python and will add additional user functionality including the ability to search and display records by user entered data instead of the hardcoded data that was included in the original project.

### Enahncement Three:  Databases

My third artifact enhancement was focused on the final project from DAD-220 Introduction to SQL where different ways of interacting with a MySQL database were explored. The project utilized a Virtual Environment that was provided by SNHU that was preloaded with the MySQL environment and associated database and my project developed MySQL command line code to interact with the database.

My enhancements will recreate the MySQL server environment and deliver a Python front end to the MySQL database that will enable the end user to search and retrieve data in a more efficient manner.
