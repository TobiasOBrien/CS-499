## Introduction

My name is Tobias O'Brien and I have been in the IT industry for close to 30 years now and started my journey in the Computer Science Program at Southern New Hampshire University in 2017.  My main motivators for starting this program were to finish a degree that I had started 30 years ago and to further develop my knowledge in Computer Science and Software Development.  I currently manage a team of Software and Infrastructure engineers and having this knowledge will assist me in furthering their development and help me drive better conversations with our customers.
