# CS-499 ePortfolio

## Introduction

My name is Tobias O'Brien and I have been in the IT industry for close to 30 years now and started my journey in the Computer Science Program at Southern New Hampshire University in 2017.  My main motivators for starting this program were to finish a degree that I had started 30 years ago and to further develop my knowledge in Computer Science and Software Development.  I currently manage a team of Software and Infrastructure engineers and having this knowledge will assist me in furthering their development and help me drive better conversations with our customers.

## Career Information

My career has afforded me the opportunity to gain exposure to many different areas of technology.  After completing some college courses, I took part in an 18-month course in Electronics, Computers, and Networking that allowed to get my first job at a VAR involved in the design, installation, and support of business networks systems.  Reflecting that this was in 1992 and Operating systems still came on floppy discs it feels like a lifetime ago.

While working for this VAR I learned quickly and was soon working on developing and maintaining IT systems for small to medium businesses.  The work involved included setting up Microsoft and Novell networks, to include the directories, email, shared file, printing, networks, firewalls, internet connectivity, and user workstations.  Along with the exposure to the software and applications required, I worked heavily with the server, desktop, mobile, storage, networking, and security hardware that was needed.

As technology progressed and I gained experienced, I started to focus my career heavily on Virtualization platforms the likes of VMware and Citrix.  It was clear that at the time the industry was moving in this direction because of the abstraction of one-to-one hardware needs, the need for increased user mobility and expense reduction.  This exposure allowed to work with customers ranging from 50 to 50,000 users truly understand how to scale solutions while providing value back to the business.

For the past 7 years of my career, I have been a manager of many different types of teams.  My first teams were operational in nature and carried the responsibility of stability and reliability for their particular focus area.  I learned so much during this time around the importance of building stability in upfront and the ITSM processes related with IT.

For the past 3 years I have been managing Software Engineer teams with subject matter experts in the Infrastructure and Software development space.  I have learned so much from my team and through self-study, peer support, and the Computer Science program I have learned so my about Software Delivery Lifecycle.

## SNHU Computer Science Program Experience

The Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire was the next logical step in my career and educational development.  Throughout my career I had always taken personal development very seriously and why I learned a lot on the job I would always ensure that I had formalized training and certification to understand and prove that I understood the foundational elements that are critical with any technology or topic.

I have always had a passion for scripting and developing code to make my and others jobs easier but never had a deep understanding of what it meant to be a true Software Developer.  The scripts and code that I had written in the past, while effective, lacked sophistication. 

When I think about all that I have learned over the past years at Southern New Hampshire University I know that I am on my way to being able to deliver that sophistication now.  I have been able to build a solid foundation of core IT knowledge, Life Skills, and Computer Science knowledge.

SNHU has exposed me to so many different new and wonderful areas to include problem solving techniques in IT-145 Foundations in Application Development, budgeting and designing solution in IT-201 Computer Platform Technologies, Linux Operating system in IT-255 Introduction to Linux Operating Systems, software systems engineering principles in IT-315 Object Oriented Analysis and Design, the importance of understanding and advocating for the end user in IT-331 Human Factors in Information Technology, and how operating systems are use in computing environments in IT-365 Operating Systems.

Along with IT courses mentioned above, advanced mathematical concepts were studied in MAT-225 Single-Variable Calculus, MAT-230 Discrete Mathematics, MAT-243 Applied Statistics for STEM, and MAT-350 Applied Linear Algebra.  These concepts allowed to gain a greater appreciate for the analysis and formulation of data and mathematical theories as the relate to Computer Science.

DAT-220, Fundamentals of Data Mining and DAD-220 introduction to Structured Databases allowed to me explore, understand, and get exposure to developing meaningful patterns in data, developing use case studies, strategies that can be used to bridge theory to factual data, data classification, clustering, and how to setup and work with structured databases environments.

CS courses brought a lot of the learning above together to apply to more advanced topics with the foundational knowledge that I had built.  CS-200 Computer Science’s Role in Industry introduced the role of customer science in different industries and expanded on the basics of programming concepts to include data types, variables, control structures, logical expressions, and arrays.  CS-250 Software Development Lifecycle allowed me to explore the different stages of the Software Development Lifecycle as a developer and as a tester and to build upon the already strong foundation that I had in Agile methodologies and practices.  CS-260 Data Structures and Algorithms brought learnings in the utilization of advanced algorithms to evaluate complex data structures to solve problems. 

Finally, the core CS courses allowed for deep learning and practice implementing all the knowledge and theories that were part of the larger Computer Science program.  CS-310 Collaboration and Team Project let me practice how Software Development teams collaborate while making code changes to include change control and version control best practices.  CS-320 Software Testing, Automation, and Quality Assurance dealt with best practices in software testing as part of SDLC and focused on requirement analysis, verification, validation, and quality management.  CS-330 Computational Graphics and Visualization allowed for the practice of C++, OpenGL, and interfacing with the hardware graphics processor.  CS-340 Client/Server Development rounded out the core CS programs though a Python and MongoDB integration that allowed for me to practice database system concepts and the principles of a client server application.

## Capstone 

This course, CS-499 Computer Science Capstone, has been a journey through my history as a student at Southern New Hampshire University.  I have been able to reflect on the courses I have taken, what I have learned, where I have struggled, and where I am headed in my career.

### Computer Science Program Experience

My courses have aloud me to study and understand the importance of IT and Software Delivery frameworks that are used as the basic building blocks in architecture, design, deliver, and support of software.  They have also shown me the benefits of Agile practices and the importance of building strong peer and team collaboration norms that enable the continued learning and development of all and ensure best practices are enriched and followed.  These practices challenge and ensure that teams are incrementally delivering solutions to the customers and through constant feedback from the stakeholders allow for validation and changes earlier in the delivery process than with previous models.  This open environment amongst the team and with the stakeholders in the end leads to better products and more value being delivered.

My courses have also given exposure to Java, Phyton, C++, OpenGL, UML, MySQL, MongoDB, and tools such as Jupyter Notebooks, NetBeans, PyCharm, Visual Studio Code, and Eclipse where I was able to work on software engineering, database setup, usage, and integration, data structure, complex algorithms all while ensuring security was front of mind.

### Capstone Experience

All the above learning was culminated in the final work that I completed on the artifacts involved in my capstone.  Each artifact touched on the various areas, Software Design and Engineering, Algorithms and Data Structure, and Databases and allowed me to self-reflect on my initial work, think about the stakeholders, and design improvements to drive greater value, stability, and security.

#### Artifact One

My first artifact was focused on the final project from IT-145 Foundations in Application Development where a Zoo authentication system for a Zoo was created allow users to be authenticated and presented with a login message based upon their role.  The program was written in Java and utilized a MD5 hashing algorithm to validate the user’s password and various Java elements to cross match the users name and role.

I choose this artifact as it would enable me to showcase my abilities to utilize software design and engineering practices through Java.  I enjoyed programing in Java at the time of the initial work but had little exposure to it since and wanted to challenge myself.  Through my code review and design process I settled on enhancing the artifact to include SHA-256 as a validation method along with MD5.  During the code review a bug with the initial code was also uncovered that enabled a security risk where a user could enter a partial username and still be validated.  This bug was also addressed in the artifact. 

This artifact allowed me to showcase the course outcome of CS-499-04 demonstrating an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals and CS-499-05 developing a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources.

#### Artifact Two

My second artifact was focused on the final project from CS-260 Data Structure and Algorithms where a bid search system was created that allowed users to load a bid file from a comma separated file and perform various searches to display data.  The program was written in C++ implement techniques such as displaying a user menu, loading, and parsing a CSV file, displaying results, and searching for bids.

I chose this artifact as my exposure to C++ was limited to this and one other class and I wanted to the experience of refactoring a program into another language.  I also remembered that during the class I identified many opportunities that could be improved upon to bring greater value back to the end user.  Through my code review and design process I settled on enhancing the artifact to utilize Python and enhancing the user experience though allowing for the search of departments and outputting the number of records, searching for records above a user entered net sales amount, and allowing the search of records by auction title keyword.

This artifact allowed me to showcase the course outcomes of CS-499-04 demonstrating an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals, CS-499-03 designing and evaluating computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution, while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices, and CS-499-01 employing strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision making in the field of computer science.

#### Artifact Three

My third artifact was focused on the final project from DAD-220 Introduction to SQL where different way of interacting with a MySQL database were explored.  The project utilized a Virtual Environment that was provided by SNHU that was preloaded with the MySQL environment and associated database and my project developed MySQL command line code to interact with the database.

I chose this artifact as one, I am a bit of a data geek, two, I wanted experience with setting up a MySQL server environment, and three, I wanted to provide the end users with a menu, user input driven system, that would allow them to complete their work more efficiently.  Through my code review and design process I settled on enhancing the artifact to include a Python front end menu system that would allow the user to input criteria and the results would be displayed.  The options that were presented for the user were viewing employees that were hired within a specific time range, search for employees with specific first and last names, search for users by employee number, search for and view employee salary information by employee number, list users by department, and an option to tell the story of a user which displayed all user’s information in a well formatted paragraph.

This artifact allowed me to showcase the course outcomes of CS-499-03 designing and evaluating computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution, while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices, and CS-499-04 demonstrating an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals.
