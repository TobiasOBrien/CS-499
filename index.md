## Introduction

My name is Tobias O'Brien and I have been in the IT industry for close to 30 years now and started my journey in the Computer Science Program at Southern New Hampshire University in 2017.  My main motivators for starting this program were to finish a degree that I had started 30 years ago and to further develop my knowledge in Computer Science and Software Development.  I currently manage a team of Software and Infrastructure engineers and having this knowledge will assist me in furthering their development and help me drive better conversations with our customers.

## Career Information

My career has afforded me the opportunity to gain exposure to many different areas of technology.  After completing some college courses, I took part in an 18-month course in Electronics, Computers, and Networking that allowed to get my first job at a VAR involved in the design, installation, and support of business networks systems.  Reflecting that this was in 1992 and Operating systems still came on floppy discs it feels like a lifetime ago.

While working for this VAR I learned quickly and was soon working on developing and maintaining IT systems for small to medium businesses.  The work involved included setting up Microsoft and Novell networks, to include the directories, email, shared file, printing, networks, firewalls, internet connectivity, and user workstations.  Along with the exposure to the software and applications required, I worked heavily with the server, desktop, mobile, storage, networking, and security hardware that was needed.

As technology progressed and I gained experienced, I started to focus my career heavily on Virtualization platforms the likes of VMware and Citrix.  It was clear that at the time the industry was moving in this direction because of the abstraction of one-to-one hardware needs, the need for increased user mobility and expense reduction.  This exposure allowed to work with customers ranging from 50 to 50,000 users truly understand how to scale solutions while providing value back to the business.

For the past 7 years of my career, I have been a manager of many different types of teams.  My first teams were operational in nature and carried the responsibility of stability and reliability for their particular focus area.  I learned so much during this time around the importance of building stability in upfront and the ITSM processes related with IT.

For the past 3 years I have been managing Software Engineer teams with subject matter experts in the Infrastructure and Software development space.  I have learned so much from my team and through self-study, peer support, and the Computer Science program I have learned so much about the Software Delivery Lifecycle.
