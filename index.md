# CS-499 ePortfolio

## Introduction

My name is Tobias O'Brien and I have been in the IT industry for close to 30 years now and started my journey in the Computer Science Program at Southern New Hampshire University in 2017.  My main motivators for starting this program were to finish a degree that I had started 30 years ago and to further develop my knowledge in Computer Science and Software Development.  I currently manage a team of Software and Infrastructure engineers and having this knowledge will assist me in furthering their development and help me drive better conversations with our customers.

## Career Information

My career has afforded me the opportunity to gain exposure to many different areas of technology.  After completing some college courses, I took part in an 18-month course in Electronics, Computers, and Networking that allowed to get my first job at a VAR involved in the design, installation, and support of business networks systems.  Reflecting that this was in 1992 and Operating systems still came on floppy discs it feels like a lifetime ago.

While working for this VAR I learned quickly and was soon working on developing and maintaining IT systems for small to medium businesses.  The work involved included setting up Microsoft and Novell networks, to include the directories, email, shared file, printing, networks, firewalls, internet connectivity, and user workstations.  Along with the exposure to the software and applications required, I worked heavily with the server, desktop, mobile, storage, networking, and security hardware that was needed.

As technology progressed and I gained experienced, I started to focus my career heavily on Virtualization platforms the likes of VMware and Citrix.  It was clear that at the time the industry was moving in this direction because of the abstraction of one-to-one hardware needs, the need for increased user mobility and expense reduction.  This exposure allowed to work with customers ranging from 50 to 50,000 users truly understand how to scale solutions while providing value back to the business.

For the past 7 years of my career, I have been a manager of many different types of teams.  My first teams were operational in nature and carried the responsibility of stability and reliability for their particular focus area.  I learned so much during this time around the importance of building stability in upfront and the ITSM processes related with IT.

For the past 3 years I have been managing Software Engineer teams with subject matter experts in the Infrastructure and Software development space.  I have learned so much from my team and through self-study, peer support, and the Computer Science program I have learned so my about Software Delivery Lifecycle.

## SNHU Computer Science Program Experience

The Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire was the next logical step in my career and educational development.  Throughout my career I had always taken personal development very seriously and why I learned a lot on the job I would always ensure that I had formalized training and certification to understand and prove that I understood the foundational elements that are critical with any technology or topic.

I have always had a passion for scripting and developing code to make my and others jobs easier but never had a deep understanding of what it meant to be a true Software Developer.  The scripts and code that I had written in the past, while effective, lacked sophistication. 

When I think about all that I have learned over the past years at Southern New Hampshire University I know that I am on my way to being able to deliver that sophistication now.  I have been able to build a solid foundation of core IT knowledge, Life Skills, and Computer Science knowledge.

SNHU has exposed me to so many different new and wonderful areas to include problem solving techniques in IT-145 Foundations in Application Development, budgeting and designing solution in IT-201 Computer Platform Technologies, Linux Operating system in IT-255 Introduction to Linux Operating Systems, software systems engineering principles in IT-315 Object Oriented Analysis and Design, the importance of understanding and advocating for the end user in IT-331 Human Factors in Information Technology, and how operating systems are use in computing environments in IT-365 Operating Systems.

Along with IT courses mentioned above, advanced mathematical concepts were studied in MAT-225 Single-Variable Calculus, MAT-230 Discrete Mathematics, MAT-243 Applied Statistics for STEM, and MAT-350 Applied Linear Algebra.  These concepts allowed to gain a greater appreciate for the analysis and formulation of data and mathematical theories as the relate to Computer Science.

DAT-220, Fundamentals of Data Mining and DAD-220 introduction to Structured Databases allowed to me explore, understand, and get exposure to developing meaningful patterns in data, developing use case studies, strategies that can be used to bridge theory to factual data, data classification, clustering, and how to setup and work with structured databases environments.

CS courses brought a lot of the learning above together to apply to more advanced topics with the foundational knowledge that I had built.  CS-200 Computer Scienceâ€™s Role in Industry introduced the role of customer science in different industries and expanded on the basics of programming concepts to include data types, variables, control structures, logical expressions, and arrays.  CS-250 Software Development Lifecycle allowed me to explore the different stages of the Software Development Lifecycle as a developer and as a tester and to build upon the already strong foundation that I had in Agile methodologies and practices.  CS-260 Data Structures and Algorithms brought learnings in the utilization of advanced algorithms to evaluate complex data structures to solve problems. 

Finally, the core CS courses allowed for deep learning and practice implementing all the knowledge and theories that were part of the larger Computer Science program.  CS-310 Collaboration and Team Project let me practice how Software Development teams collaborate while making code changes to include change control and version control best practices.  CS-320 Software Testing, Automation, and Quality Assurance dealt with best practices in software testing as part of SDLC and focused on requirement analysis, verification, validation, and quality management.  CS-330 Computational Graphics and Visualization allowed for the practice of C++, OpenGL, and interfacing with the hardware graphics processor.  CS-340 Client/Server Development rounded out the core CS programs though a Python and MongoDB integration that allowed for me to practice database system concepts and the principles of a client server application.
