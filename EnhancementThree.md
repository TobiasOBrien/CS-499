# Enhancement Three: Databases

The artifact that has been chosen for Enhancement Three:  Database was the final project from DAD-220 Introduction to SQL that was completed in April of 2019.   The project included different ways of interacting with a MySQL database to include connections, searching, and displaying records.  As the project that I was working with in 2019 was no longer available I utilized the sample database, Employees, that was available on MySQL.com (https://dev.mysql.com/doc/employee/en/).  The database was of similar construct and included multiple tables that held employee information such as employee number, hire date, birth date, title, and salary.  My artifact presents a python front end to the MySQL database that allows the user to select options via a menu and provide input to complete tasks. 

I choose this artifact as I wanted experience with setting up a MySQL Database and wanted to learn how to interact with it through Python.  When originally working on the project I remember thinking that the work could be improved if users did not have to type out each command and recall the exact syntax to get the results they needed.  The effort required me to setup a MySQL server, import the database, understand the schema, work with the Python MySQL connector, think about the user experience, and embed SQL code into Python.  The combination of working with the underlying database, designing a simple user interface, and working though the code needed to satisfy the user actions was a great experience to refresh my learning in those spaces.

The outcome of my project allows for the user to interact with the data more efficiently through a menu that was created in Python.  Depending on the option selected the user is presented with simple questions where their input is saved into variables and passed to the SQL query to obtain the results.  This is a major improvement from the original project and will allow the program to be utilized by non-database administrators that do not have specific MySQL skills.  The work will also improve the reliability and efficiency of how the data is utilized.

As mentioned in the previous sections, the work required for this effort involved new learnings for me.  Setting up a MySQL server, importing and verifying the database and working with the Python connector for MySQL was something that I never had exposure to previously.  The installation of MySQL and working through the understanding of the Database schema went well and for the most part I was able to learn the syntax needed for the Python MySQL connector with ease.  The only real struggle that I had was selecting and filtering data when there was a one-to-many relationship between tables and ensuring I was selecting the correct records.  After reviewing the documentation and understanding the different ways to join the tables I was able to solve the problem. 

The course objectives that were planned with this artifact were to provide a front end to the MySQL calls.  This objective was completed and the work to enable the front-end connection to MySQL and create the code queries that were necessary to fulfill the clientâ€™s requirements showed my abilities to utilize well founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices to deliver value.

This artifact allowed me to showcase the course outcomes of CS-499-03 designing and evaluating computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution, while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices, and CS-499-04 demonstrating an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals.
